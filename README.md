## About MarchMadnessPicker
Tools for generating probabilistically filled-out March Madness brackets.

## Executables
* {BUILD_DIR}/kenpom_scraper/kenpom_scraper.py [-o output_file] [-y year]

Pulls team data from kenpom.com to an output json file. Output file defaults to "kenpom-data.json". If year is specified end-of-season data for that year is queried (at present this dates back to 2002). Current data is queried if unspecified.

* {BUILD_DIR}/src-picker/picker -i input_file [-f file_log_level] [-s screen_log_level]

Performs a tournament simulation. Relevant log levels are debug, warning, error, and off. A sample input file is provided at sample_inputs/input.json. Minimum requirements are a "team_data_file" (which should be generated by kenpom-scraper.py) and "bracket_data" (which defines seeding within regions to generate matchups).
